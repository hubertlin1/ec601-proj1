## Attempted Implementation
Since I was relatively unfamiliar with speech processing, I decided to start with basic implementation of voice commands. I tried to see if I could get the program to differentiate based on word spoken. I was able to adapt some material on the MATLAB File Exchange and repurpose it for my experimentation. Once I had word differentiation, I tried to use the same approach to differentiate between user, which worked if the users' waveforms were unique enough, but struggled when the users' had similar characteristics. In the future, given less time constraint, I would like to try a machine learning approach and focus more on improving the recognition.
